# MicroC 2.0 Setup Complete

## Build System Successfully Configured

The MicroC 2.0 project now has a complete, professional build and development system with all necessary files:

### Created Files

#### Core Build Files
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `setup.py` - Traditional setup script
- `pyproject.toml` - Modern Python packaging configuration
- `Makefile` - Development automation commands
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns

#### Documentation
- `docs/running_simulations.md` - Complete simulation guide
- `docs/custom_functions_and_gene_manipulation.md` - Gene manipulation guide
- `docs/building_and_development.md` - Development setup guide
- Updated `README.md` - Project overview with build instructions

### Verified Installation

The build system has been tested and works correctly:

```bash
✅ make help - Shows all available commands
✅ make install-minimal - Successfully installs MicroC package
✅ Dependencies resolved - All required packages installed
```

## Quick Start Commands

### For Users
```bash
# Install and run
git clone <repository-url>
cd microc-2.0
make install-minimal
make run-example
```

### For Developers
```bash
# Full development setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd microc-2.0
make install-dev
make test
make format
make docs
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Professional Package Structure
- Modern `pyproject.toml` configuration
- Proper dependency management
- Entry points for command-line tools
- Package data inclusion

### 2. Development Automation
- Code formatting with Black and isort
- Linting with flake8 and mypy
- Testing with pytest and coverage
- Documentation building with Sphinx

### 3. Multiple Installation Options
- Minimal: Core dependencies only
- Development: All dev tools included
- Optional extras: performance, visualization, jupyter

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation
- User guides for running simulations
- Developer guides for contributing
- Gene manipulation tutorials
- Build system documentation

## Gene Network Improvements Included

### NetLogo-Style Implementation
- Sparse single-gene updates (10-50 steps optimal)
- Proper fate node initialization (start as False)
- Random initialization for regulatory genes
- Realistic apoptosis rates (1-5% under optimal conditions)

### Configuration-Driven Design
- YAML-based configuration system
- No hardcoded values in source code
- Flexible gene manipulation framework
- Custom function support

## Next Steps

### For Project Maintainers
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline using the provided Makefile targets
2. Configure documentation hosting (ReadTheDocs compatible)
3. Set up package distribution (PyPI ready)
4. Add integration tests for full workflows

### For Users
1. Follow the [Running Simulations Guide](docs/running_simulations.md)
2. Explore [Gene Manipulation Examples](docs/custom_functions_and_gene_manipulation.md)
3. Check [Development Guide](docs/building_and_development.md) for contributing

### For Developers
1. Run `make install-dev` to set up development environment
2. Use `make ci-test` before submitting pull requests
3. Follow the code standards enforced by the build system
4. Update documentation when adding new features
